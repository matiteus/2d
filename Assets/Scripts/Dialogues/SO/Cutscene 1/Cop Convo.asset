  dialogue:
  - Ah, you're here at last...
  - As you've seen in the files, the mayor's son was kidnapped, and it didn't seem
    like a normal kidnapping.
  - There was no contact, no ramson request, no nothing...
  - The mayor is going crazy.
  - We called the best on the field, and they couldn't find him.
  - As last resort, they told me that, if someone can do it, it's you.
  - The only lead we found is that the kid was last seen close to the tree north
    east from here.
  - There is a crow that keeps coming back and screaming there, there's no way you'll
    miss it!
